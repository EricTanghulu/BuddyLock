# BuddyLock Starter (iOS, SwiftUI)

**BuddyLock** is an iOS app that helps people reclaim their time by combining **screen-time limits** with **social accountability**. Instead of managing limits alone, BuddyLock lets your friends (or accountability partners) play an active role in keeping you focused.

This repo is a **starter project** showcasing how to use Apple‚Äôs Screen Time APIs (Family Controls, Managed Settings, and Device Activity) to build a socially-driven digital wellbeing app.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Screen Time Integration**  
  Requests iOS 16+ permission to manage app & domain limits.

- **Family Activity Picker**  
  Choose which apps, categories, and websites to shield.

- **Shields & Focus Sessions**  
  Block apps immediately or run time-boxed focus sessions that end automatically.

- **Customizable Shield UI**  
  Sample extension that can display ‚ÄúAsk a Friend‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot Now‚Äù when a user tries to open a blocked app.

- **Device Activity Monitor**  
  Example extension for scheduling daily/weekly screen-time challenges.

- **Buddy Approval Service (stub)**  
  A protocol stub for implementing friend-based approvals with CloudKit, Firebase, or any backend of your choice.
